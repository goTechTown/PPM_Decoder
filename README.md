# PPM\_DecoderA class for decoding a [Pulse Position Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-position_modulation) signal used by many remote controllers. This class is primarily for use with Arduinos.# Description## PPM\_Decoder( _pinNbr_ , _nbrOfChs_, _nbrOfSams_, _syncTimeMs_ )Creates a PPM_Decoder object (constructor).### _Arguments_* uint8_t pinNbr: the pin where the PPM signal in coming in.* unsigned nbrOfChs: the number of channels being transmitted.* unsigned nbrOfSams: The number of samples to take and average. Default is 1.* unsigned long syncTimeMs: The sync time of the PPM signal in milliseconds. Default is 5000.## bool isValid()Returns whether or not the decoder object is valid. The object allocates memory internally and if the allocation fails, the object will be invalid.### _Return values__true_ - object is valid<br>_false_ - object is not valid.##void update()Updates the channel values received. If _­nbrOfSams_ (in the constructor) is > 1, then multiples values are received.## unsigned value( _channel_ )Returns the value of the requested channel. If  _­nbrOfSams_ (in the constructor) is > 1, then the average value is returned.
